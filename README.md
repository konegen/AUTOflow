  Autoflow is a tool that helps developers to implement machine learning (ML) faster and easier on embedded devices. The whole workflow of a data scientist should be covered. Starting from building the ML model to the selection of the target platform to the optimization and implementation of the model on the target platform.

## Features
- __GUI interface:__ With this framework we offer a GUI, which should facilitate the entry into the AI as far as possible.
- __AUTOML:__ With the help of AUTOML techniques, ML models can be generated automatically. No experience with ML is required.
- __automatic compression:__ Existing ML models can be automatically compressed to reduce the size and speed of the model
- __automatic Code generation:__ The framework automatically generates code for the target platform.
- __different target platform:__ MCUs, FPGAs, Arduino, Raspberry PI etc.

## List of files and folders

| File name     | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| GUI.py        | Execute this file to start the GUI. All functions of the GUI are defined in here.                                        |
| pruning.py    | This script executes the pruning. The functions pruning and pruning_for_acc start the pruning and return a pruned model. |


### Auto_TF_to_uC

This directory contains the scripts for the automated implementation of the project.

| File/Folder name       | Description   |
| ---------------------- | ------------- |
| Converted_model_files  | This folder contains the converted TensorFlow lite models which are converted through this tool.                                                                                                                                 |
| TensorFlow_library     | The TensorFlow library with all neccesary source and header files.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| convert_keras_to_cc.py | The function convert_model_to_tflite() converts a keras model to a TensorFlow lite file. The function convert_model_to_cpp() converts the TensorFlow lite model into a cpp model so that it can be executed on the microcontroller. |
| create_project.py      | This script converts the model, creates the project directory and generate all files that are needed to compile the project.                                                                                                        |
| write files_uc.py      | In this script the project directory is created and all files are generated which are used for the project.                                                                                                                         |


### Images

All images required for the GUI design are stored in this folder.


### Threads

This directory contains all threads which are needed to run the GUI correctly.

| File name                | Description   |
| ------------------------ | ------------- |
| Create_project_thread.py | This thread calls the function from create_project.py to create all files of the project. It then executes the bash script of the created project to compile and load the project onto the microcontroller.               |
| Loading_images_thread.py | In the UILoadWindow of the GUI the project folder with all necessary files is created and the binary file is loaded onto the microcontroller. Meanwhile, this thread performs the display of a loading screen in the GUI. |
| Prune_model_thread.py    | If the neural net is to be reduced by pruning, this is done in this thread.                                                                                                                                               |

| UIOptiWindow.py        | The window where the optimizations (pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation and huffman coding are optional) of the neural network are selected.                                                                       |
